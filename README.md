## Password Game
Our program uses a loop to ask for password input indefinitely until the player enters a password which matches all criteria. To assess which criteria need be displayed for any given password entry, we have a function which contains a sequence of “if” checks: one for each rule. If a rule is met, nothing happens and the code proceeds with the next rule check. If, however, a rule is not met, the function returns the number of that rule so the main loop can display it (and all the previous rules) and ask for new input.
